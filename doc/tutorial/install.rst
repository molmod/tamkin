Installation of TAMkin software
###############################


Disclaimer
==========

TAMkin is mainly developed and tested on Linux systems. If you run any other
operating system, some of the instructions below may not work.


External depedencies
====================

Some other software packages should be installed before TAMkin can be installed
or used. It is recommended to use the software package management of your Linux
distribution to install these dependencies.

The following software must be installed for TAMkin:

* Python >=3.6: http://www.python.org/doc/
* Numpy >=1.16.0: http://numpy.scipy.org/
* Scipy >=0.17.1: http://www.scipy.org/
* MatPlotLib >=1.1: http://matplotlib.org/
* MolMod >=1.4.5: https://github.com/molmod/molmod/
* PyTest >=4.6: https://docs.pytest.org/

Most Linux distributions can install most required software with a single
command. Except for Python, missing dependencies will get automatically
installed by pip. (See below.)

* **Ubuntu**

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt install python3 python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-matplotlib python3-pytest python3-pip cython3

* **Debian 5** or newer. You first have to become root because the sudo program is not
  configured by default::

.. code:: bash
    
    su -
    apt-get install python python-numpy python-scipy python-matplotlib python-pytest
    exit

* **Fedora 32 and up**

.. code:: bash
    
    sudo dnf install python3 python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-matplotlib python3-pytest python3-Cython


Installation
============

TAMkin can be installed with pip (system wide or in a virtual environment):

.. code:: bash

    pip install numpy
    pip install tamkin
    pip install pytest  # only needed to run unit tests

Alternatively, you can install TAMkin in your home directory:

.. code:: bash

    pip install numpy --user
    pip install tamkin --user
    pip install pytest --user  # only needed to run unit tests

Lastly, you can also install TAMkin with conda. (See
https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

.. code:: bash

    # Using the builds from Travis-CI ...
    conda install -c molmod tamkin pytest
    # ... or using the packages on conda-forge
    conda install -c conda-forge tamkin pytest



Testing your installation
=========================

Just run, after installation, the following command to test your copy of TAMkin:

.. code:: bash

    pytest -v tamkin

If some tests fail, post an issue on https://github.com/molmod/tamkin/issues
